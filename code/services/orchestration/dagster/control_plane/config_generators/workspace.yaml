# Outlines the data pipelines
# (organized collections of tasks that process and move data)
# and resources (such as external databases, APIs, and storage services)
# that are active and accessible in a given workspace,
# allowing Dagster to manage these components collectively for a specific project environment.
# This setup ensures that only the pipelines and resources explicitly defined in workspace.yaml
# are available for use in the Dagster environment.
